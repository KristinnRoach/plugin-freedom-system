# Resume Point

## Current State: Creative Brief Complete

Creative brief has been finalized for SimpleSampler. Ready to proceed to UI mockup or implementation.

## Completed So Far

**Ideation:** ✓ Complete
- Core concept defined: Minimal POC sampler for JUCE learning
- Parameters specified: Volume (0-1), Tuning (±12 semitones)
- UI vision captured: GainKnob-style interface with sample loading
- Use cases identified: Learning tool, Ableton testing, foundation for expansion

## Next Steps

1. Create UI mockup to visualize design (recommended)
2. Start implementation directly
3. Research similar plugins for inspiration

## Context to Preserve

**Key Decisions:**
- Plugin type: Synth (Instrument)
- Core concept: Single sample loading, 16-voice polyphonic playback
- Scope: Intentionally minimal POC - no trimming, looping, or effects (future features)
- Root note: C3 (MIDI 60)
- Velocity-sensitive volume
- File formats: WAV, AIFF, MP3
- Sample loading: Drag-drop + file browser

**Files Created:**
- plugins/SimpleSampler/.ideas/creative-brief.md
- PLUGINS.md entry added
